# Installation

Rhasspy should run in a variety of software environments, including:

* Within a [Docker](#docker) container
* As a [Hass.io add-on](#hassio)
* Inside a [Python virtual environment](#virtual-environment)
    * Running as a [service](#running-as-a-service)
* Build [from source](#build-from-source)

## Docker

The easiest way to try Rhasspy is with Docker. To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/):

    curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh

and that your user is part of the `docker` group:

    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER

**Be sure to reboot** after adding yourself to the `docker` group!

Next, start the [Rhasspy Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/synesthesiam/rhasspy-server) in the background:

    docker run -d -p 12101:12101 \
          --restart unless-stopped \
          -v "$HOME/.config/rhasspy/profiles:/profiles" \
          --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd \
          synesthesiam/rhasspy-server:latest \
          --user-profiles /profiles \
          --profile en

This will start Rhasspy with the English profile (`en`) in the background (`-d`) on port 12101 (`-p`) and give Rhasspy access to your microphone (`--device`). Any changes you make to [your profile](profiles.md) will be saved to `~/.config/rhasspy`.

Once it starts, Rhasspy's web interface should be accessible at [http://localhost:12101](http://localhost:12101). If something went wrong, trying running docker with `-it` instead of `-d` to see the output.

If you're using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), add the following to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

    rhasspy:
        image: "synesthesiam/rhasspy-server:latest"
        restart: unless-stopped
        volumes:
            - "$HOME/.config/rhasspy/profiles:/profiles"
        ports:
            - "12101:12101"
        devices:
            - "/dev/snd:/dev/snd"
        command: --user-profiles /profiles --profile en
        
### Updating Docker Image

To update your Rhasspy Docker image, just run:

```bash
docker pull synesthesiam/rhasspy-server:latest
```
on your Rhasspy server and restart the Docker container.

## Hass.io

The second easiest was to install Rhasspy is as a [Hass.io add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/). Following the [installation instructions for Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/) before proceeding.

To install the add-on, add my [Hass.IO Add-On Repository](https://github.com/synesthesiam/hassio-addons) in the Add-On Store, refresh, then install the "Rhasspy Assistant" under “Synesthesiam Hass.IO Add-Ons” (all the way at the bottom of the Add-On Store screen).

![Synesthesiam add-on store](img/hass-io-store.png)

**NOTE:** Beware that on a Raspberry Pi 3, the add-on can take 10-15 minutes to build and around 1-2 minutes to start.

Watch the system log for a message like `Build 8e35c251/armhf-addon-rhasspy:2.11 done`. If the “Open Web UI” link on the add-on page doesn’t work, please check the log for errors, wait a minute, and try again.

Before starting the add-on, make sure to give it access to your microphone and speakers:

### Updating Hass.IO Add-On

You should receive notifications when a new version of Rhasspy is available for Hass.IO. Follow instructions from Hass.IO on how to update the add-on.

## Virtual Environment

Rhasspy can be installed into a Python virtual environment, though there are a number of requirements. This may be desirable, however, if you have trouble getting Rhasspy to access your microphone from within a Docker container. To start, clone the repo somewhere:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synesthesiam/rhasspy.git
```

Then run the `download-dependencies.sh` and `create-venv.sh` scripts (assumes a Debian distribution):

```bash
cd rhasspy/
./download-dependencies.sh
./create-venv.sh
```

Once the installation finishes (5-10 minutes on a Raspberry Pi 3), you can use the `run-venv.sh` script to start Rhasspy:

```bash
./run-venv.sh --profile en
```

If all is well, the web interface will be available at [http://localhost:12101](http://localhost:12101)

### Updating Virtual Environment

To update your Rhasspy virtual environment to the latest version, run:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

in your `rhasspy` directory. You should also re-build the web interface:

1. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) on your system
2. Run `yarn build` in the `rhasspy` directory
3. Restart any running instances of Rhasspy

### Running as a Service

Once installed, Rhasspy can be run as a [systemd service](https://systemd.io/). An [example unit file](https://github.com/synesthesiam/rhasspy/blob/master/etc/rhasspy.service) is available (thanks [UnderpantsGnome](https://github.com/UnderpantsGnome)):

```
[Unit]
Description=Rhasspy
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/<USER>/path/to/rhasspy
ExecStart=/bin/bash -lc './run-venv.sh --profile <LANGUAGE>'

RestartSec=1
Restart=on-failure

StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog

SyslogIdentifier=rhasspy

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

* Replace `/home/<USER>/path/to/rhasspy` with the full path to your Rhasspy installation (where `run-venv.sh` is).
* Replace `<LANGUAGE>` with your profile language (e.g., `en`)

Create a file named `rhasspy.service` in the `/home/<USER>/.config/systemd/user` directory (you may need to create the directory itself). Once the file has been saved, run:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Then, you can start Rhasspy with:

```bash
systemctl --user start rhasspy
```

If you'd like Rhasspy to start on boot, run:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now rhasspy
```

## Build From Source

The `create-venv.sh` script uses [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/synesthesiam/rhasspy/releases/tag/v2.0) for Rhasspy's required tools:

* [OpenFST](https://www.openfst.org)
* [Opengrm](http://www.opengrm.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/NGramLibrary)
* [Phonetisaurus](https://github.com/AdolfVonKleist/Phonetisaurus)
* [Kaldi](https://kaldi-asr.org)

The [build-from-source.sh](https://github.com/synesthesiam/rhasspy/blob/master/build-from-source.sh) attempts to build all of these tools from source. The binary artifacts (command-line tools, shared libraries) are installed into the `bin` and `lib` directories of a Python virtual environment. The `run-venv.sh` script automatically adds these directories to `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before starting Rhasspy.

### Swap Size

On low memory devices like the Raspberry Pi, building the tools above can quickly consume the entire RAM. Before building, it's highly recommended that you increase the available swap space by several gigabytes:

1. Edit `/etc/dphys-swapfile`
2. Change `CONF_SWAPSIZE` to something large, like 2048 (2GB)
3. Reboot

### Kaldi

You can skip building Kaldi if you plan to just [use Pocketsphinx](speech-to-text.md#pocketsphinx) for speech recognition.

### Updating Source Install

Follow the same instructions as [updating a virtual environment](#updating-virtual-environment).
